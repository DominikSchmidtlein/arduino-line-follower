# Project Charter
## Project objectives (Irusha)
The objective of the project is to create a robotic platform that can be used with different configuration of sensors to succed in three types of path-finding challenges (Line following, static maze solving, and dynamic maze solving).
 
## Stakeholders (Charlie)
 * Customer: Prof. A.-M. Cretu 
 * Group Members: Irusha, Dominik, Charlie
## Project scope (Dominik)
### In scope
#### Robot construction 
* physical construction
* wire assembly
#### Software 
* writing software to operate the motors via the Arduino libraries
* interpreting sensor data and feeding into decision algorithm
#### Algorithm development 
* designing the logic by which the robot decides how to follow line and exit maze
* avoiding fixed obstacles phase 2, 3 specific
* determining maze exit without black line phase 2, 3 specific
* adapting to reconfigurable maze phase 3 specific
* find the heat source phase 3 specific
### Out of scope
maze construction, design, etc.
